Anyways my creator is the great and amazing Dream...... or Whodley........ or Bradley Givens.........or whatever you want to call him. Not only did he make me but he made this game too. Warning!!! He did not make my responses, thats all me <3<3<3. So dont be a dickhead about it and get mad at him. SOOOO!!!!! here are the rules.\n",

    "## Rules \n",
    "* Pick your difficulty and spell it right. Dont be stupid\n",
    "* So this game is basically hangman but that name is inapropriate for many reasons\n",
    "* I may be an asshole but im a politcally correct one\n",
    "* The game will generate a word, all you have to do is a guess a letter until you get the word\n",
    "* Pay attention to the hints they will help you\n",
    "* Once you are out of lives you loose the game\n",
    "* Finally DO NOT PICK EXPERT!!!!!! YOU ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH!!!!!"
